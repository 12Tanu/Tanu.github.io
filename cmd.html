<p>To find the history in linux ,use command-

$ history </p>

<p>You can also use history to rerun the last command you entered by typing !!. And, by pairing it with grep, you can search for commands that match a text pattern or, by using it with tail, you can find the last few commands you executed. For example:
<br>
$ history | grep dnf
<br>
$sudo dnf update -y
<br>
$ history | grep dnf
<br>
$ history | tail -n 3 </p>

<p>Another way to get to this search functionality is by typing Ctrl-R to invoke a recursive search of your command history. After typing this, the prompt changes to:
(reverse-i-search)`': </p>
